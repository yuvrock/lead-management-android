## Lead (sales lead)
A sales lead is a potential sales contact, an individual or organization that expresses an interest in your goods or services. Leads are typically obtained through the referral of an existing customer, or through a direct response to advertising or publicity. A company's marketing department is typically responsible for lead generation.

#### How it works
*Lead-Management* in the call process shows a notification. If the user clicks this notification, they will simply be redirected to the application to save the contact. If the contact exists, you will see details of the caller, if not you will be redirected to adding this number as contact. After this, the app stores data of the caller in the local database.
This app is currently in development, which means that in the future, many more features will be added.

### Work Flow
* A Splash Screen that displays the app icon every time that app is launched.
* A Quick Walk-thorugh (Slider) of the Visiting Card Android App when the App is launched for the first time.
* A Login Activity to ensure only Authentic Users use the app - implemented using Firebase Authentication.
* A Base Activity with a bottom navigation bar that allows the user to navigate through the list of contacts and groups.
* Contacts Fragment that shows the saved contacts in a Recycler View with a FAB to add a new contact
* Clicking on the Recycler View item opens a Dialog that shows the information for that contact and allowing us to edit/call them.
* Clicking on the Edit Screen opens the Edit Contact Activity.
* Inside the Base Activity, click on the FAB opens the same Edit Contact Activity to add a new contact.
* The app should also show a notification when the call is ended, asking the user to save the details for that contact.
* On clicking the notification, if the caller's details exists on the server, show it to the user, else ask the user to enter their details.
