## Lead (sales lead)
A sales lead is a potential sales contact, an individual or organization that expresses an interest in your goods or services. Leads are typically obtained through the referral of an existing customer, or through a direct response to advertising or publicity. A company's marketing department is typically responsible for lead generation.

#### How it works
Lead-management-android in the call process shows notification, by clicking notification you simply will be redirected to application to save the contact. If the contact exists, you will see details of the caller, if not you will be redirected to adding this number as contact, then it stores data of this caller in local database.
This app is currently in development, means that in future many more features will be added.
